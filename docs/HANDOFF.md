# MAI Founding Engineer Handoff

**Project:** Island Mountain Model Abstraction Interface (MAI)
**Source:** MAI-BUILD-PROMPT-ROSTER.md (Session 65, 2026-05-15)
**Status:** Phase A+B complete. Next: Session 11 (MAI API Server Implementation).
**Archive:** Detailed Phase A+B code inventory and onboarding walkthrough archived to [HANDOFF-ARCHIVE-01.md](HANDOFF-ARCHIVE-01.md) on 2026-05-17.

## What You Are Picking Up

The MAI is the core inference abstraction layer for IM-OS, Island Mountain's sovereign data and identity operating system. It sits between all application logic (chat, document AI, medical records, home automation, legacy preservation) and all inference hardware (NVIDIA GPUs today, AMD GPUs, classical memristors in 2028, quantum memristors in 2030+).

The inference engine is a plugin. The data sovereignty layer is the product.

### Codebase (Phase B Complete)

5 Rust crates and 7 Python adapters are implemented. The mai-core kernel (scheduler, power state machine, health monitor, hot-swap manager), mai-hil drivers (NVIDIA, AMD, CPU, TetraMem stub), and mai-adapters framework (subprocess IPC, cgroups isolation, crash recovery) are all production code with 86+ unit tests, 14 E2E integration tests, and 8 benchmarks passing. CI is green. See [SESSION-LOG-ARCHIVE-01.md](SESSION-LOG-ARCHIVE-01.md) for detailed line counts and per-session deliverable lists.

**CI fixes applied 2026-05-17:** (1) pytest collection failures fixed (missing `adapters/__init__.py`, added `conftest.py`). (2) `AdapterBase.__init__` now accepts optional config dict; all 6 non-Ollama adapters updated to match. (3) Stale test assertions corrected (llamacpp context_size, tensorrt ports). **Still needed:** run `cargo fmt` locally (Rust formatting drift), fix Sglang's `self._raw_config` reference (should be `self._config`).

**Response Cache (Session 10d, 2026-05-17):** Standalone `mai-core/src/cache.rs` module (627 lines, 12 unit tests). LRU eviction with TTL, memory budget enforcement, profile isolation, blake3 key hashing. Not yet integrated into scheduler or hotswap (deferred to Session 11 when API layer provides proper entry points). Types added to `mai-core/src/types.rs`.

**Immediate next step:** Execute **Session 11** (MAI API Server: axum REST, tonic gRPC, SSE streaming, WebSocket, auth middleware, audit middleware, air-gap startup verification).

## Five Things That Will Bite You If You Ignore Them

**1. The HIL is the moat.** The hardware interface layer survives hardware generations. The TetraMem MX100 arrives in 2028. The HIL is what makes that transition painless. Cut corners here and you become a one-generation company.

**2. Adapters are disposable. The core is not.** Backend adapters (Sessions 08-09) can be rewritten when Ollama's API changes or vLLM ships v2. The core kernel (Session 07) and API surface (Session 11) cannot be rewritten without breaking every application above them.

**3. Air-gap is not a checkbox.** It is an architectural constraint affecting every session. Every component must work with zero network access. If you find yourself writing `if air_gap_mode:` conditionals, you have already failed. The default is air-gapped. Network is the exception.

**4. PQC is ahead of schedule, on purpose.** ML-KEM and ML-DSA deployment in 2026 puts Island Mountain ahead of the NIST 2030 deadline by four years. This is a competitive advantage. Session 12 builds it.

**5. The quantum memristor transition is not science fiction.** TetraMem has shipping eval hardware. The HIL and adapter framework are designed so a TetraMem adapter slots in without changing a single line of core kernel or application code. If your implementation violates that property, you have failed the most important test.

## Critical Path (Remaining)

The longest remaining dependency chain:

**11 -> 12 -> 15 -> 17 -> 18** (5 sessions sequential)

Sessions that can overlap (if multiple sessions available):
- Sessions 14, 15, 16 can run in parallel (different subsystems, shared dependencies met after 12)

Realistic remaining calendar: 10-14 Cowork/Code sessions.

## What Is NOT In Scope

These items are explicitly excluded. See [KNOWN-ISSUES.md](KNOWN-ISSUES.md) for the full list.

- L6 UI (React dashboard, onboarding wizard)
- Remote support tunnel (network service, not MAI)
- Landfall Council (multi-user chat variant, deferred)
- Full L4 agent logic (RAG pipeline internals, tool implementations)
- Full L5 application logic (only scaffolds are built)
- TetraMem adapter implementation (stub interface only)
- Photonic adapter implementation (stub interface only)
